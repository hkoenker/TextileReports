Both Stata and R were used for analysis and presentation of the findings.\n\nMethods\n\nPublicly available datasets were downloaded from dhsprogram.com and mics.unicef.org. Appropriate survey weights were applied using the “svy” command in Stata and the “survey” package in R. Regression results for the maps on the homepage were run with the svy: logistic command in Stata; those in the reports were run with the svyglm command in R, using a quasi-binomial specification.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis website provides reports for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate whether there are differences in use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) due to the textile of ITNs (i.e. polyester or polyethylene).\nSome countries may wish to procure ITNs of a particular textile. These reports use large household survey data to evaluate whether there are differences in use between polyester and polyethylene nets in a particular country, and whether net textile is associated with these differences after controlling for other determinants of net use.\nThese reports walk through several key questions to ask as we consider this question and provide recommendations for next steps.\nThis work is supported by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention with funding from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nData from the most recent MIS, DHS, and MICS were obtained with permission from dhsprogram.com and mics.unicef.org. We plot several maps below of relevant indicators.\n\nHow big are the differences in use between PE and PET nets?\n\nFigure 1 presents the crude (absolute) difference between the proportion of polyester nets used the previous night and the proportion of polyethylene nets used the previous night. In nearly all cases this difference is less than 10 percentage points and the majority of recent surveys show no significant difference in the overall use rate of nets of different textiles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Crude difference in % of nets used between textiles\n\n\n\n\nIs textile an important predictor of net use after controlling for other factors?\n\nFigure 2 summarizes countries where the most recent survey shows a correlation between the textile of a net and whether it was used the previous night. In most countries, textile is not significantly correlated with use when controlling for other key factors, such as the household’s net supply (# of nets and # of family members), the month of the survey (seasonality), region, urban/rural, and wealth quintile.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation of textile with use: adjusted for household supply of nets, net age, region, wealth, urban/rural, net age, and month\n\n\n\n\nHow complete is the information we have for net textile in these surveys?\n\nThe textile is determined from the brand information collected in the survey; in some surveys the proportion of nets with an unknown brand can be considerable. Figure 3 summarizes the proportion of nets with an unknown brand and thus an unknown textile. This provides important context when interpreting results above.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proportion of nets with unknown brand & textile\n\n\n\n\nDo countries have primarily one type of net, or a mix?\n\nFigure 4 illustrates the relative share of polyester and polyethylene nets within countries - darker reds indicate a high proportion of polyethylene nets, and darker blues indicate majority polyester nets. It’s important to keep in mind this is from the time of the most recent survey; the picture may be different if the survey has a high percentage of nets with an unknown brand (see above), and if a country has conducted a mass campaign since the survey.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Proportion of nets that are polyester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta analysis across countries\n\nThis forest plot summarizes the regression results for all available surveys, restricted to the most recent survey for each country. The bottom line shows that overall, polyethylene nets are only slightly less likely to be used the night before compared to polyester nets (adjusted odds ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.98) when controlling for background factors.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Forest Plot summarizing odds of a PE net being used; most recent survey per country\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
