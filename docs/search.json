      "contents": "\nThis website provides reports for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate whether there are differences in use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) due to the textile of ITNs (i.e. polyester or polyethylene).\nSome countries may wish to procure ITNs of a particular textile. These reports use large household survey data to evaluate whether there are differences in use between polyester and polyethylene nets in a particular country, and whether net textile is associated with these differences after controlling for other determinants of net use.\nThese reports walk through several key questions to ask as we consider this question and provide recommendations for next steps.\nIn four countries, publicly available surveys have collected information on household preferences for net textile. This data is summarized on the Preferences page.\nThis work is supported by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention with funding from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\nData from the most recent MIS, DHS, and MICS were obtained with permission from dhsprogram.com and mics.unicef.org. We plot several maps below of relevant indicators. We want to look at a few key questions:\nHow big are any differences in use between polyester and polyethylene nets?\nIf both nets are used at largely the same rates, the choice of textile is unlikely to be a major consideration for procurements\nWhat is the contribution of textile to net use after controlling for other factors?\nMany other factors influence net use decisions; textile is only one. It can be closely related to net age, for example, if an earlier campaign was one type and the most recent campaign a different type. It’s important to control for these factors to assess whether textile remains important predictor of net use. If it is not an important predictor, programmes can feel comfortable procuring both types of nets.\nAre the findings above consistent?\nIf there is both a difference in the use rate between textiles, and textile is an important predictor after controlling for other factors, it may be worthwhile to explore further. If the findings above are contradictory, programmes can feel comfortable procuring both types of nets.\nHow complete is net textile information?\nIt’s good to confirm whether the data about net textile is complete; if a large percentage of nets are missing information, we should feel less certain about the overall results.\nDo countries have a mix of nets, or predominantly one type?\nIt’s also good to check whether countries have predominantly one type of net, as this can potentially skew some of the results above.\nWhat’s happening at the regional level?\nNational level results can mask regional variation. Currently we present regional results within the country reports and for selected countries on this page. Additional regional-level results are currently in development.\nWhat is the overall trend across countries?\nResults can be combined from multiple countries to assess the overall trend in net use as a function of textile.\n\nHow big are the differences in use between PE and PET nets?\n\n\nFigure 1 presents the crude (absolute) difference between the proportion of polyester nets used the previous night and the proportion of polyethylene nets used the previous night. In nearly all cases this difference is less than 10 percentage points and the majority of recent surveys show no significant difference in the overall use rate of nets of different textiles.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Crude difference in % of nets used between textiles\n\n\n\n\nIs textile an important predictor of net use after controlling for other factors?\n\n\nFigure 2 summarizes countries where the most recent survey shows a correlation between the textile of a net and whether it was used the previous night. In most countries, textile is not significantly correlated with use when controlling for other key factors, such as the household’s net supply (# of nets and # of family members), the month of the survey (seasonality), region, urban/rural, and wealth quintile.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Correlation of textile with use: adjusted for household supply of nets, net age, region, wealth, urban/rural, net age, and month\n\n\n\n\nAre the findings above consistent?\n\n\nThe results from Figures 1 and 2 can frequently be contradictory. A country like DRC shows a crude difference in the percent of nets used of between 5-10 percentage points - but textile is not a significant predictor of use in the multivariate regression model. Conversely, Senegal has no difference in the crude use rate for nets of different textile, but when controlling for background factors, textile is significantly associated with use. The map below summarizes which countries have these ‘inconclusive’ findings, and for which countries both the crude use rate differences and the model results are telling the same story. In these countries, further exploration is warranted.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Crude and adjusted results\n\n\n\n\nHow complete is the information we have for net textile in these surveys?\n\n\nThe textile is determined from the brand information collected in the survey; in some surveys the proportion of nets with an unknown brand can be considerable. Figure 4 summarizes the proportion of nets with an unknown brand and thus an unknown textile. This provides important context when interpreting results above.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Proportion of nets with unknown brand & textile\n\n\n\n\nDo countries have primarily one type of net, or a mix?\n\n\nFigure 5 illustrates the relative share of polyester and polyethylene nets within countries - darker reds indicate a high proportion of polyethylene nets, and darker blues indicate majority polyester nets. It’s important to keep in mind this is from the time of the most recent survey; the picture may be different if the survey has a high percentage of nets with an unknown brand (see above), and if a country has conducted a mass campaign since the survey.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Proportion of nets that are polyester\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch out for in-country variation!\n\n\nThe below graphs present data on the difference in the percent of nets used the previous night for regions within four of the five countries where both the crude use rate shows a sizeable difference between textiles, and the multivariate regression model indicates textile is significantly associated with use. We can see that large parts of Burkina Faso have no observable difference in use between textiles, while two regions are leaning towards polyester nets, contributing to the national results. For Guinea, the regions around Conakry have higher rates of use for polyethylene nets (red), while the reverse is true in the south-eastern regions. But remember that net age is not accounted for here - differences in use could be because certain regions of the country have newer nets of one type, and have discontinued use of older nets of the other type.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Regional maps of the crude difference in polyester vs polyethylene net use. Blue indicates more polyester nets are used than polyethylene nets; red indicates more polyethylene nets are used.\n\n\n\nThe four maps below show the results of the multivariate model for each region. Blue regions are where polyethylene nets are less likely to be used (around half as likely in some regions of Burkina Faso and Liberia, compared to polyester), while red regions are where polyethylene nets are more likely to be used (up 2-3 times as likely in some parts of Guinea and Rwanda).\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Regional maps of the coefficient for textile in the adjusted model at regional level. Blue indicates polyethylene nets are less likely to be used than polyester nets; red indicates a higher likelihood that polyethylene nets are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeta analysis across countries\n\n\nThis forest plot summarizes the regression results for all available surveys, restricted to the most recent survey for each country. The bottom line shows that overall, polyethylene nets are only slightly less likely to be used the night before compared to polyester nets (adjusted odds ratio: 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.98) when controlling for background factors.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Forest Plot summarizing odds of a PE net being used; most recent survey per country\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\n\n\nFrom the findings above, most countries should feel comfortable that both polyester and polyethylene nets are used at similar rates. While people have preferences about textile, it appears that other factors are more important when deciding to use nets. Distribution of nets of the less-preferred textile is unlikely to lead to significant reduction in use. At subnational level, preferences can likewise vary. National programmes should continue to procure ITNs that respond to the insecticide resistance profile within their country as a top priority. Regional-level findings can be used to inform distribution planning when procurements contain both types of textile.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nA very limited number of surveys ask questions about the preferred textile for ITNs. These include Madagascar 2016, Liberia 2016, Sierra Leone 2016, and Rwanda 2017. (A 2013 survey in Madagascar also contains this question but is not included here). With the data about respondent preferences, we can assess whether textile preference is associated with whether a particular net is used the night before the survey.\n\nHow the question is asked is important\n\nWhile all surveys included a “Don’t know” option for the question about textile preferences, only Liberia and Madagascar included an option for “no preference” in their survey questionnaires. We recommend that future surveys include an option for “no preference” when asking about preferences for net attributes (textile, color, shape, etc), as it provides an important indication of the strength of these preferences. Expressing a preference for a certain material does not necessarily mean that individuals will not use nets of the other material, as the rest of this website shows.\nIn Rwanda, the question about the preferred material was asked for each net in the household. Of the 4205 households in the survey, only 32 households reported different preferences for the nets within their household; the rest (99.3%) had consistent preferences for one type or the other. The data shown here has collapsed these preferences from the net level to the household level so that the unit of analysis for all four surveys is the household. In the future we would recommend that surveys ask the preference questions at the household level, not the net level, as the net-level question does not provide any additional insights.\n\nWhat are the textile preferences in each country?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreferences tend to vary by wealth quintile, so let’s take a look at preferences for net textile for each country, stratifying by wealth quintile. Sierra Leone and Liberia look similar, with most respondents preferring polyester nets, highest for respondents in the richest quintiles. In Madagascar, around half of respondents had no preference, and most of the rest preferring polyester, with some small differences by wealth quintile. In Rwanda, the majority prefer polyethylene nets: from about half of all poorest households, to over 80% of the richest households.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Reported preferences for net material by wealth quintile\n\n\n\nWe see a similar pattern when stratifying by urban/rural residence. Sierra Leone and Liberia have more preference for polyester in urban areas, and slightly less in rural. Urban areas in Rwanda prefer polyethylene to a greater degree than rural areas.\nKeep in mind that those in the richer wealth quintiles and/or urban areas tend to have access to more options for acquiring nets, and may have more agency to act on their preferences for certain net types. Households in rural areas and those in the lower wealth quintiles have limited options for acting on their preferences, and thus may feel they have to make do with whatever options are available.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Reported preferences for net material by residence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre the current nets the preferred textile?\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in the graph below that in Madagascar, the majority of nets during the 2017 survey were the preferred textile, and that in Sierra Leone and Liberia, around half of all nets were the preferred textile. Slightly less than half of all nets in Rwanda 2017 were the preferred textile.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proportion of nets that are the household’s preferred textile\n\n\n\nWe can break this chart down further into specific categories for preferred and not-preferred nets of the two textiles. In Rwanda 2017, the preferred nets were split more or less evenly between the two textile types, although we can still see in the light orange bar that the majority of nets were polyester nets owned by households that would have preferred polyethylene.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Proportion of nets that are the household’s preferred textile, by type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegression models - is preference associated with net use?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe below table summarizes the results of generalized linear models to assess the associations between textile preference and the likelihood of a net being used the previous night. We have created a variable from the reported preference and the textile of the net - a binary variable indicating whether a net in the household is the preferred textile or not. Only in Liberia 2016 is this variable significantly associated with the odds of a net being used the previous night - nets of the preferred textile were 1.39 times more likely to have been used than those that were not the preferred textile, controlling for the other factors in the model.\nThe model also shows us that the household net supply - whether they have not enough nets, the right number of nets (at least 1 per 2 people, but less than one net per person), or ‘too many’ nets (1 per person or more) is strongly associated with the likelihood of net use in all models.\n\n\nhtml {\n
