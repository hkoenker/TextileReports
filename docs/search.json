Both Stata and R were used for analysis and presentation of the findings.\n\nMethods\n\nPublicly available datasets were downloaded from dhsprogram.com and mics.unicef.org. Appropriate survey weights were applied using the “svy” command in Stata and the “survey” package in R. Regression results for the maps on the homepage were run with the svy: logistic command in Stata; those in the reports were run with the svyglm command in R, using a quasi-binomial specification.\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nThis website provides reports for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate whether there are differences in use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) due to the textile of ITNs (i.e. polyester or polyethylene).\nSome countries may wish to procure ITNs of a particular textile. These reports use large household survey data to evaluate whether there are differences in use between polyester and polyethylene nets in a particular country, and whether net textile is associated with these differences after controlling for other determinants of net use.\nThese reports walk through several key questions to ask as we consider this question and provide recommendations for next steps.\nThis work is supported by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention with funding from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
