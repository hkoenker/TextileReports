This website provides [reports](reports.html) for countries in sub-Saharan Africa to evaluate whether there are differences in use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) due to the textile of ITNs (i.e. polyester or polyethylene).

Some countries may wish to procure ITNs of a particular textile. These reports use large household survey data to evaluate whether there are differences in use between polyester and polyethylene nets in a particular country, and whether net textile is associated with these differences after controlling for other determinants of net use.

These [reports](reports.html) walk through several key questions to ask as we consider this question and provide recommendations for next steps.

This work is supported by the Alliance for Malaria Prevention with funding from The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

<h1>Summary</h1>
Data from the most recent MIS, DHS, and MICS were obtained with permission from dhsprogram.com and mics.unicef.org. We plot several maps below of relevant indicators. Figure \@ref(fig:usediff) presents the crude (absolute) difference between the proportion of polyester nets used the previous night and the proportion of polyethylene nets used the previous night. In nearly all cases this difference is less than 10 percentage points and the majority of recent surveys show no significant difference in the overall use rate of nets of different textiles.

Figure \@ref(fig:sigmultivar) summarizes countries where the most recent survey shows a correlation between the textile of a net and whether it was used the previous night. In most countries, textile is not significantly correlated with use when controlling for other factors.

# Note: Due to differences in the calculation of standard errors between R and Stata for generalized linear model (glm), the map results above for Burkina Faso and for Chad (multivariate model) are opposite of results in the full reports. Planners should take account of the uncertainty in these estimates.

The textile is determined from the brand information collected in the survey; in some surveys the proportion of nets with an unknown brand can be considerable. Figure \@ref(fig:txtunknown) summarizes the proportion of nets with an unknown brand and thus an unknown textile. This provides important context when interpreting results above.

Figure \@ref(fig:polyester) illustrates the distribution of textiles within countries - darker reds indicate a high proportion of polyethylene nets, and darker blues indicate majority polyester nets at the time of the most recent survey.
